Use this application from the command line, no X interface yet.

You can call it this way :
python timetask.py

And it will give you a list of choices available at each step. 
Or you can call them directly :
python timetask.py timer current

Don't forget to add a symlink to your /usr/bin or $HOME/bin if you want to be able to call the application directly.
